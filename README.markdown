## The new Serendipity Backend

These new backend files are strictly based to the Serendipity branch 2.0. Please download and install a current [2.0 branch](https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/tree/2.0) first and keep it strictly updated!

Make sure to use the 2k11 template

Copy the `include` and `templates` directories onto that installation to replace the old Backend files.
